As the world's population becomes increasingly urbanized, researchers and agencies have devoted increasing attention to understanding travel patterns in urban areas. Many of the existing data topics ([temporal](Temporal_data), [spatial](Spatial_data), [travel survey](Travel_survey_data)) overlap with urban data as they are all various facets of the data needed for local governments and MPOs to make decisions about how to invest in infrastructure. The purpose of this page is to tie together some of the concepts of other data and models to bridge the gaps between the problems urban planners seek to solve, the models available to study these problems, and the data both necessary and available to answer questions related to urban travel.

## Summary

Members and Friends of the [TRB Committee on Urban Transportation Data and Information Systems (ABJ30)](https://sites.google.com/site/trbabj30/) have compiled a list of commonly used data sources and tools. In compiling the content for this section, contributors included data sources and tools that they regularly use or are exploring. Contributors also included some information about emerging trends and issues to consider with respect to some of these data sources.
