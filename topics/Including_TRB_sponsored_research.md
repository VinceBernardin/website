------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teams preparing proposals to conduct research intended for publication by TRB should consider this wiki as a possible medium by which to communicate all or part of their final products with the intent of promoting their use in practice and encouraging community dialogue and contribution to the subject matter.

Research programs under TRB are encouraged to include specific guidance in requests for proposals (RFP) regarding appropriate placement and treatment of research products within this wiki.

Suggested RFP Language
----------------------

TRB-sponsored panels charged with drafting RFPs related to travel forecasting research and practice should consider including the following language with the intent of ensuring that contractors understand the importance of integrating and promoting their research products among the travel forecasting community.

* The proposal should discuss the ways in which the research products can be promoted through [tfresource.org](http://tfresource.org). This includes identifying which existing or potential categories the proposed research best fits and drafting a preliminary content outline for a Topic Page that will be created as a research product.
* The proposal should include a specific task, along with an appropriate allocation of time and personnel, related to preparing Topic Pages within [tfresource.org](http://tfresource.org) that present the research products in an expository style. The intent shall be to introduce the research products within the context of travel forecasting practice. This task includes researching [tfresource.org](http://tfresource.org) for related Topic and Resource pages and establishing meaningful links to these within the new Topic Page.
* The proposal should include a specific task, along with an appropriate allocation of time and personnel, related to preparing a Resource Page within [tfresource.org](http://tfresource.org) that provides the official abstract of the final report(s) and to which it can be externally linked upon publication. This task includes researching [tfresource.org](http://tfresource.org) for relevant Topic pages and establishing meaningful links to the new Resource Page within the content of those pages.
